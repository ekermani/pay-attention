# pay-attention

This neck accessory forces you to pay attention to what is happening in front of you, rather than looking down at your phone.  I utilizing the tilt switch for the interaction input and DC motor for the output.  When the choker is pointed downwards the motor will vibrate to remind you to look up again; when the head is tilted upwards and the tilt switch steady (not at an angle), the motor will slow down to eventually stop.  

After the initial iterations, I found code that was better suited to the tilt sensor and added it to the transistor/motor control code.  I assembled the transistor and motor and tested it with a button switch.  Then changed the button to a tilt switch.  The motor requires a 9V battery to properly function for this purpose.

The part I struggle with is getting the motor to stop in a reasonable time.
